		<h2>Excellent and professional team</h2>
			<p>
				Our daughter and my family would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for the excellent work and professionalism that the AUSOME team has constantly practised and will hopefully continue to do so in the future.We wish AUSOME all the very best in all your endeavours, and God-willing, we will meet again when we return to Wales. May God bless your good and kind efforts.

		<h2>A thorough and proper assessment for my child!</h2>
			<p>
The way the assessment at AUSOME was conducted along with the outcome was completely different to our previous experience. AUSOME took more than 2 hours to do a thorough assessment using the proper assessment tools that were not used by the previous doctor. Surprisingly AUSOME found that while my son showed some signs of autism, he not fulfil the complete requirements and instead gave us specific strategies and recommendations to help him.
			</p>
		</div>


		


		<div class="col-sm-12 fade">
		<h2>He had grown into a bubbly, witty and happy seven year old</h2>
			<p>
I am glad I discovered it before it was too late for my little boy.
			</p>
		</div>

		

		<div class="col-sm-12 fade">
		<h2>AUSOME has shown us that there is hope</h2>
			<p>
In just 3 months we have seen a number of improvements. His poor eye contact is now on par with a typical child. He had little or no imitation skills but now these skills are out-standing. He is becoming increasingly more social with children his own age. When he started the programme he had zero words – he now tries to say 6 different words. A big step in 3 months.
			</p>
		</div>


		
	


		<div class="col-sm-12 fade">
		<h2>A Round of Gratitude for Your Commitment and Professionalism!</h2>
			<p>
AUSOME has shown commitment and very professional service in administrating all their programs. Their programs are very structured with proper plans and records. Supervisors are very skilled, knowledgeable and most importantly helpful. Both my son and daughter have benefited a lot under AUSOME’s program. Thank you with all our hearts.
			</p>
		</div>

	

		<div class="col-sm-12 fade">
		<h2>Thank you!</h2>
			<p>
She has learnt to sit down at the table by listening to the therapist. She picked up toileting skills and has improved on eye contact.

		<h2>Thank You for Your Commitment to Our Son. Our Son Enjoys Sessions Very Much!</h2>
			<p>
We feel that ABA has helped improve a lot of daily skills for our son. Therapists from AUSOME have professionally and playfully implemented the ABA programs to achieve that. He is doing so much just after 6 months. For the therapy to be successful, commitments from parents and AUSOME therapists are needed. We are grateful for their commitments and regular check/ review on the things to do and concentrate on to ensure success.
			</p>
		</div>


		


		<div class="col-sm-12 fade">
		<h2>Vast Language Improvement</h2>
			<p>
He has starting having more language than what he had before ABA. He can now do some activities on his own and interacts well with children his age as oppose to only adults previously. He looks forward to his sessions at AUSOME daily because the therapist makes him feel comfortable.
			</p>
		</div>

	

		
	

		<div class="col-sm-12 fade">
		<h2>Overcoming Difficulties One Step at a Time</h2>
			<p>
When my son was diagnosed to have autism, he was struggling and lagging far behind in a mainstream kindergarten. He also had difficulties with communication, aversion to certain foods and other behaviours associated with autism. Since starting ABA at AUSOME, we have watched him develop and work through these difficulties, one small step at a time. He has only been with AUSOME for 7 months but the difference is remarkable. We also understand him better and know how to help him. We have great hopes that he will grow up to be successful and lead a fulfilling life. He has just been re-enrolled in a mainstream kindergarten. Good job guys!
			</p>
		</div>

	

		<div class="col-sm-12 fade">
		<h2>Maximized Potential</h2>
			<p>
Each child progresses in a different way and although Timothy’s progress has not skyrocketed, I believe that ABA has maximized his potential.
			</p>
		</div>


	


		<div class="col-sm-12 fade">
		<h2>An All-Round Approach</h2>
			<p>
We have received tremendous patience and support from the AUSOME staff known to us, their compassion and kindness never detracting from their professionalism. It was a good day when AUSOME came into our lives.

		<h2>AUSOME made an enormous difference</h2>
			<p>
We are very grateful that AUSOME is providing much-needed services for children on the autism spectrum in KL.  AUSOME’s presence was a decisive factor — indeed, the decisive factor — in our decision to accept a posting here.
